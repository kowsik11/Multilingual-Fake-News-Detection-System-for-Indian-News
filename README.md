# 📰 Multilingual Fake News Detection System for Indian News 🇮🇳

This project aims to build a **Multilingual Fake News Detection System** specifically for **Indian News** articles. With a wide range of languages in India, this system is designed to detect fake news across multiple languages, such as **Hindi**, **Tamil**, **Telugu**, **English**, and more. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (**NLP**) and Machine Learning models, this system analyzes news articles and classifies them as **fake** or **real** based on various features like text patterns, linguistic cues, and external data validation.

## 📝 Project Description

The **Multilingual Fake News Detection System** focuses on identifying fake news in Indian languages by analyzing news articles in **Hindi**, **Tamil**, **Telugu**, **English**, and more. By using a variety of machine learning algorithms and **NLP techniques**, this system can process text in different languages and detect whether the news is authentic or not. The system considers a wide variety of sources, news formats, and language-specific patterns to accurately classify news articles.

### 🔑 Key Features:
- **Multilingual Support**: Detects fake news in multiple Indian languages.
- **News Text Processing**: Uses NLP techniques to preprocess and extract features from the news articles.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Applies supervised learning algorithms like **Random Forest**, **SVM**, and **Naive Bayes** to classify news articles.
- **External Data Validation**: Cross-references news articles with reputable sources to validate their authenticity.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Provides real-time detection of fake news articles by analyzing the input text.

## 🧠 Features of the System

- **Multilingual Support**: Supports multiple languages such as Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and English.
- **News Text Preprocessing**: Tokenizes, lemmatizes, and removes stopwords to clean up the text data.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracts features from news articles using **TF-IDF** or **Word2Vec** models.
- **Model Training**: Trains machine learning classifiers on a large dataset of labeled fake and real news articles.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Classifies input news articles as **fake** or **real**.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- **NLP**: NLTK, SpaCy, TextBlob
- **Multilingual Support**: Google Translate API for translation, custom models for multilingual text processing
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Database**: SQLite for storing news articles and model outputs
